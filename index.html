                Everyone works together in pursuit and support of the same promise offered by the founders of this country. The rights and opportunities promised to all who came and all who stayed.
The right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And the right and opportunity for self-governance.
As Mayor and official of the people's government of the City of San Jose, it would be my job to lead the council in the management and development of the cities' resources and assets.
My goal is to reaffirm and secure the promised rights to all individuals and citizens of San Jose. Reestablish and guarantee our right to be governed by the people and for the people.
I will provide all city residents the opportunity to collaborate and provide input into the creation of the safest, happiest and self-sustaining city in the world.
